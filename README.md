### What is this?

"Arcane Quarters" is a video game map I am designing for the game *Quake.* This is actually my first entry into the process of designing levels for multiplayer games!

## Overview

### Backstory

The level takes place in a small, abandoned castle, deep within a forest. It has been rumored that the castle has been the housing of an important weapon that can destroy monsters. However... This has driven a few to kill at all costs to obtain it.

### Level Description

With dark lighting and intriguing interior decor, the players will become fascinated with what's inside the castle corridors, while keeping their guard up at all times. There are spaces in the map that demonstrate both close and long-range combat, and items the player obtains as they explore deeper within the castle. **Simplicity** and **symmetry** are the main elements of the map, that get increasingly complex as you reach the lower floors, with the second basement becoming more risky. The player can become accustomed to the pattern of the map, knowing when to strike or hide from other players. There are also 2 secret passages that give the player an advantageous weapon, one of them being another entry to into a lower floor.
With high ceilings, there is a possibility that the player can take the high ground and take easy shots at opponents...

## 2D Map Diagrams

Here are 2D, top-down diagrams for the first floor (1F), basement floor 1 (B1), and basement floor 2 (B2). The secret passage on B1 is a diagonal route that reaches from the bottom-right to the top-left of the map. The player can traverse between floors by using a ladder (though this may be replaced with something else in the future), and on the deepest level, there is a portal that the player can escape from combat, that takes them to Floor 1F.
